Here's the breakdown:

random.randrange(): This part is like a special dice in Python that rolls numbers within a specific range. You tell it where to start and stop, and it picks a random number between those limits.
pow(10, NUM_DIGITS - 1) and pow(10, NUM_DIGITS): These parts are like setting up the boundaries for the dice. They use a math trick to create numbers with a specific number of digits, like building fences to keep the dice within a certain area.
Here's how they work together:

Imagine a number dial: Think of a dial with lots of numbers on it, like a combination lock or the odometer in a car.
Setting the starting point: The first pow(10, NUM_DIGITS - 1) part sets the starting point for the dial. It creates a number with the specified number of digits minus one, like a marker for where the dice can start rolling.
Setting the ending point: The second pow(10, NUM_DIGITS) part sets the ending point for the dial. It creates a number with the exact number of digits you want, like a finish line for the dice.
Rolling the dice: The random.randrange() function then rolls the dice within those boundaries, picking a random number from the starting point to the ending point, but not including the ending point itself.
Example:

If you want a random number with 3 digits:
The starting point would be 100 (10 to the power of 2, which is 3 digits minus 1).
The ending point would be 1000 (10 to the power of 3, which is 3 digits).
The dice would roll any number between 100 and 999, like 542, 817, or 235.
Key points:

This code is often used to generate random numbers for games, passwords, or other situations where you need unpredictable values.
You can change the NUM_DIGITS part to control how many digits you want in the random number.
Python's random module has other cool functions for generating random things, like names, colors, or even choices from a list!
