## 1. Introduction:

This project, named "Game Center", is a collection of fun, engaging games developed in Python. It is designed for users to select and play games from a list of choices. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the project's structure, the games included, the code involved, and various Python functionalities used.

## 2. Software and Hardware Requirements:

### Software:
- **Python**: Version 3.x (It's the programming language in which all games and functionalities are written.)

### Hardware:
- Any basic computer system (like a PC or laptop) capable of running Python.

## 3. Game Descriptions:

1. **Mastermind**: A classic game where the player tries to guess a random 4-digit number. Feedback is given on each guess to assist the player in making subsequent guesses.
2. **Jumbled Word Game**: Players are given a jumbled word, and they must unscramble it.
3. **Word Guessing Game**: Similar to 'Hangman,' players guess characters for a hidden word.
4. **2048 Game**: A popular sliding puzzle game. The goal is to merge tiles with the same numbers, eventually reaching the 2048 tile.

## 4. Libraries and Packages Used:

1. **random**: This module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions. Functions like `randint` and `choice` are used from this module.
    - `randint(a, b)`: Return a random integer between a and b (inclusive).
    - `choice(sequence)`: Return a random element from the sequence.

2. **subprocess**: Allows spawning new processes, connecting to their input/output/error pipes, and obtaining their return codes.
    - `run(args)`: Used to run the shell commands. In this project, it is used to execute Python game files.

## 5. Detailed Code Explanation:

The main driver file is `main.py`. When run, it repeatedly displays a menu of games to the user. The user can select a game or choose to quit. Each game is present in a separate Python file.

### main.py:

- An infinite `while` loop is utilized to keep showing the game menu.
- `print` functions are used to display the menu.
- `input` function gets the user's game choice.
- A series of `if-elif-else` conditions check the user's input, and the appropriate game is run using `subprocess.run`.
- If the user chooses to quit, a thank-you message is displayed, and the loop ends.
- If an invalid choice is entered, the user is notified, and the menu is displayed again.

### Game Files:

Each game has its structure, logic, and functionalities defined in its Python file. The games use loops, conditions, functions, and various Python constructs.

For a more in-depth dive into the code of each game, refer to the provided game files.

## 6. Python Functions Explanation:

- **print**: Used to display text or data on the console.
- **input**: Reads a line from input (usually user input from keyboard) and returns it as a string.
- **int**: Converts a given value into an integer data type.
- **str**: Converts a given value into a string data type.
